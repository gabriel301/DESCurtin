Implementation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) Algorithm as an Assigent of the Subject Fundamental Concepts of Criptography 220  
from Curtin University, Semester 1 2014.  
## Assignment
### Implement DES in C/C++ or Java. The requirements are follows:  
* The input of plaintext for your code is required to be any text file instead of its direct binary representation.  
* The key for encryption and decryption is required to be any combination of characters and symbols with any length.  
* You are required to implement key generation, switch function and K function first and then combine all of these operations to achieve DES.  
* After finishing your programming, and make sure it works properly. Then you can change the Sbox by your self and check whether your code still works.
